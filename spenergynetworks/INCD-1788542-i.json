Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair grounded overhead power lines affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6:30pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 2:32pm on Thursday, 04 February 2021",
