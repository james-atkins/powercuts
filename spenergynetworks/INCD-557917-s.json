  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the G33 and G69 postcode areas of Stepps and Muirhead. We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to connect generators to the network for the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4am. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 2:28am on 28th March",
