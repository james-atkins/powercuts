  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut affecting the EH45 postcode area of Peebles. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 11:50pm. Our team have managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and still working to repair a fault on our electrical network, however our team are having difficulties onsite due to weather conditions and we still expect all power to be restored by Midday. We understand that to be without power is frustrating and we apologise for this. We will update this message if this information changes. Thank you for your patience.
