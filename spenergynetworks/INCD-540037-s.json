We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have established an underground cable fault and are waiting extra help to remove slabs to enable us to dig down to the cable fault and we now expect your supply to be restored by 12:30am. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
