Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to complete a repair on a grounded overhead line caused by a fallen down tree affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6:30am. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 3:07 AM on Monday, 02 November 2020.",
