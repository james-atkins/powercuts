  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the KA26 Postcode area of Girvan, affecting a large number of customers in a wide spread area. We had no advance warning of the power cut and only became aware of it at 4.43AM. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair the fault on our overhead line network affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 12PM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 6.48AM on 7th December 2020.",
