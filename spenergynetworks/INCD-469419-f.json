Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to locate and repair a faulty underground cable which is affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4.00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 11.58am on the 19th of October 2020.",
