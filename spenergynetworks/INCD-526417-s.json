  "TRANSCRIPT": "There is a power cut in the G15 postcode area of Glasgow. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 5:34pm. Repairs are taking longer than expected as our team have now established an underground cable fault and require a digging team to attend site. Our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 1:00am. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 7:36pm on 4th January 2021.",
