  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the SY18 postcode area of Llanidloes, affecting properties in Old Hall and surrounding areas. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at  5:45PM. Our emergency response team has managed to restore power to a number of properties, and we are working to restore power for those customers still off supply. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the repairs required to replace a overhead line pole and our team are now working to get the power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 3:00AM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 11:07PM on 16th January 2021.",
