  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the CW6 postcode area of Tarporley, affecting properties in Peckforton, Spurstow and surrounding area. Our emergency response team has managed to restore power to a number of properties, and we are working to restore power for those customers still off supply. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the complexity of the work required to repair the damage to our underground cable network caused by a third party.  Our engineers are now resourcing generators to restore supplies as quickly and as safely as possible by 1.00AM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 9.30PM on 28th October 2020.",
