  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the KY8 postcode area of Leven, affecting properties in Links Road and surrounding streets. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 12.49pm. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the complexity of the repairs required following damage by a 3rd party to an underground cable and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 10.00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 3.45pm on Wednesday 7th April 2021.",
