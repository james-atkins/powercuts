  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the KA23 postcode area of West Kilbride, affecting a number of properties in the local area. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 7.35AM.  Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to carry out repairs on the overhead line network located at Hunterston House affecting the rest of our customers without power. Repairs are taking longer than expected due to the complexity of the repair. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 12.30PM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 10.48AM on 16th November 2020.",
