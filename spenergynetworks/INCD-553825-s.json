  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the G75 postcode area of East Kilbride, affecting properties in Ocein Drive and surrounding areas. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 8.11am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a grounded overhead line at Jackton Wood caused by a possible bird strike affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 2pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 10.03am on Tuesday 16th March 2021",
