  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the EH35, EH37 EH38 postcode areas of Tranent, Pathhead and Ormiston. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 3.10pm. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair grounded overhead lines at Costerton Mains Farm for our customers who are still without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 10pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 4.55pm on 11th November 2020",
