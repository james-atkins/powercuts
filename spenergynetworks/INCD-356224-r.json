  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the WA9 postcode area of St Helens affecting properties in Gloucester Street, Ramford Street, Smithfield Street and the surrounding area. Repairs are taking longer than expected because our engineers need to isolate faulty equipment on the underground cable network before they can safely replace fuses at the substation. We are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 7:00PM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 2:15PM on 7th February 2021",
