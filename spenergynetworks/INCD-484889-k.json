We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 6.46pm. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the complexity of the repairs required for the underground cable fault and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6am. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 9:35 PM on Sunday, 14 February 2021.",
