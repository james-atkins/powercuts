We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and became aware of this at 5:25PM. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to complete repairs to an underground cable fault on Manor Street affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4am. We will update this message if this information changes.
