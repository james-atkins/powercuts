So far we have managed to restore power to a number of properties by replacing blown fuses at the local substation & are now working to repair a fault on our underground cable network and we now expect your supply to be restored by 4pm. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
