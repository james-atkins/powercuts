We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 1:30pm. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a grounded overhead power line affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 8:00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 2:50pm on Monday, 8th February 2021",
