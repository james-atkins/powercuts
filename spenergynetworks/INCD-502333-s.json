Repairs are taking longer than expected because of extensive repairs required to a broken pole near Muirhead Farm and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 11.00PM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was recorded at 2.40PM on 31 October 2020.",
