  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the G72, G73, G74 and G76 postcode areas of Glasgow. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 7:25am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to locate and repair a fault on our overhead line network affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 12:00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 9:17am on Tuesday, 09 March 2021",
