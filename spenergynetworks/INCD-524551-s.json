Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working on the overhead line fault affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4AM. If this information changes then we will make every effort to contact you. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 00:40AM on 29 December 2020.",
