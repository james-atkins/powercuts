  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the G5 postcode area of Glasgow, affecting properties in Polmadie Road and surrounding streets. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 7.50am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a fault on the underground cable network affecting the rest of our customers without power. Due to the complexity of the repair we now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4pm.  We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 12.34pm on 8th March 2021",
