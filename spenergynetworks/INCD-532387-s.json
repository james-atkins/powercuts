So far we have managed to restore power to a number of properties, we are still installing fault finding equipment on our overhead line network to help identify the fault location and our team are currently carrying out further investigations on the network at Castlemilk Smithy. We now expect your supply to be restored by 3am. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
