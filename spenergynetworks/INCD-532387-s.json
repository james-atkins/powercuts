Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area, we are currently on site installing fault finding equipment, as we are still working to locate and repair the fault affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 11.30pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 8.28pm on Tuesday 19th January 2021.",
