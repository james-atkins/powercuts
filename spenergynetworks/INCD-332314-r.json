  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the KY4 postcode area of Cowdenbeath, affecting properties in Broad Street and surrounding streets. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 11.11am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties via generator supply and are still working on the underground cable fault affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by midnight. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 2.09pm on 29th October 2020.",
