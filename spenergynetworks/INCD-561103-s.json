It was necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 1:10pm due to emergency network checks being required at the Carlops substation and this may be affecting the supply to your property. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of further repairs required to our underground electricity network and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4:30pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 3:24pm on Tuesday, 06 April 2021",
