So far we have identified an underground electricity cable fault outside 107 Weensland Road and there have been further delays due to an incident on site where emergency services had to attend site and we were unable to access site to complete repairs, we are now able to access site again and we expect your supply to be restored by 8.30pm. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
