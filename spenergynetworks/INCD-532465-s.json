  "TRANSCRIPT": "There is a power cut affecting the EH46 and EH45 postcode area of West Linton and Peebles. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 12:02am. Engineers onsite have managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are working to repair a grounded overhead line between Earlyburn Observatory and Cloich. We still expect all power to be restored by 11am. We understand that to be without power is frustrating and we apologise for this. We will update this message if this information changes. Thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 4:47am on 20th January",
