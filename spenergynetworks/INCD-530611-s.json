  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the TD1 postcode area of Galashiels. We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have identified an underground cable fault outside 10 Balmoral Drive and worked alongside SGN to make the area safe. We have now been given the go ahead by the gas networks and are working to complete a permanent repair by 8:00pm. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
