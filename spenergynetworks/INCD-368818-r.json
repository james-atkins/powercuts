We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have found further faults on our underground cable network near the Newbattle Abbey substation and we now expect your supply to be restored by 9PM via generator. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
