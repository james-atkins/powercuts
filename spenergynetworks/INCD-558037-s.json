  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is power cut in the G67 and ML6 areas of Cumbernauld and Airdrie. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 9:52am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a grounded overhead electricity line in the Cameronburn area affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 2pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 10:41am on Sunday, 28 March 2021",
