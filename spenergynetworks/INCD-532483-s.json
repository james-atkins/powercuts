  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut affecting the EH37, EH38, TD1 and TD2 postcode areas of Pathhead, Herriot, Galashiels and Lauder. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and engineers onsite are carrying out investigations into reports of grounded overhead line equipment at Fountainhall. We still expect all power to be restored by 6am. We understand that to be without power is frustrating and we apologise for this. We will update this message if this information changes.
