Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to make repairs to overhead line equipment due to third party damage affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 5am. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 10:00 PM on Thursday, 25 March 2021.",
