  "TRANSCRIPT": "There is a power cut affecting the LL14 postcode area of Wrexham. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 11:51pm. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and still working to repair a fault on our underground cable network near Afoneitha substation and we still expect all power to be restored by 6am. We understand that to be without power is frustrating and we apologise for this. We will update this message if this information changes. Thank you for your patience.
