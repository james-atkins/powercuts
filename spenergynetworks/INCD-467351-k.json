  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the EH47 postcode area of Bathgate. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 7.31pm. We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we established there is an underground cable fault affecting supplies on Almond Square, to safely progress the fault our engineers need to remove further supplies at 11.45pm and we now expect your supply to be restored by 4.00am. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
