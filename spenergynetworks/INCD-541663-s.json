We did not know in advance there would be a power cut however our engineers have now arrived on site and due to the type of fault, we had to carry out an emergency shutdown. This may affect the supply to your property. For those that we have removed power from we will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4am. For all others who have been effected earlier tonight we will require access to each property to check the incoming supply and appliances and we expect these visits to commence from 9am on Saturday 13th February.
