It was necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown due to a fault with our underground cable network in the area and this may be affecting the supply to your property. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of ongoing fault investigations and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6am. We will also require access to each property to check the incoming supply and appliances and we expect these visits to commence from 9am on Saturday 13th February.
