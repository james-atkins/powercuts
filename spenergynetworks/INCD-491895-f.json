  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is an unplanned power cut in the KY11 postcode area of Dunfermline. It was necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 12:35am due to an unsafe situation with our underground cable network fault on Woodmill Crescent and this may be affecting the supply to your property. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working with Scottish Water to carry out safe repairs to the fault affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4am. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 2:43am on 6th February.",
