  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the G71 postcode area of Uddingston, affecting properties in Myers Crescent and surrounding streets. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 3:15pm. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working on an underground cable fault on Myers Crescent affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by Midnight. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 7:33pm on 12th January 2021.",
