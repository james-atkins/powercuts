  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is an unplanned power cut in the PA8 postcode area of Erskine. It was necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 1:15am due to a tree on the overhead line network at Erskine Ferry House and this may be affecting the supply to your property. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to complete investigations and repairs affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6am. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 2:15am on 6th February.",
