Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area but have now located a secondary fault on the network affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 3:00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 11:50am on Thursday, 31st December 2020.",
