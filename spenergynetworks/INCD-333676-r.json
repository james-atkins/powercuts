Our team on site have inspected the March Road substation and have now established an underground cable fault near Hillpark Way. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the complexity of the work required and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 8:00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 2:55pm on Friday 6th November 2020",
