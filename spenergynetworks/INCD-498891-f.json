  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the KA24 postcode area of Dalry. We did not know in advance there would be a power cut and are working to get supplies restored. So far, we have arrived onsite and confirmed there is a grounded overhead line. Due to the location of this it has been difficult getting our equipment to the location to commence repairs and we now expect your supply to be restored by 3.30pm. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
