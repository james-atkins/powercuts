  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the TD11 postcode area of Duns. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of this at 7:54PM. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a snapped pole which is resulting in overhead cables hanging low which is affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 2AM. If this information changes then we will make every effort to contact you. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 9:38PM on 14 April 2021.",
