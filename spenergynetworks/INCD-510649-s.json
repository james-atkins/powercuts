Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a fault on our overhead line network near Bargeddie Church affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6.00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 3.49pm on the 24th of November 2020.",
