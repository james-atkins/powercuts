  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut affecting the CW7 postcode area of Winsford. We did not know in advance there would be a power cut and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have identified an underground cable fault on Carlisle Close. Our team also needed to remove power to additional properties in the area at 6am in order to carry out safe repairs. We now expect your supply to be restored by 10:30am. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
