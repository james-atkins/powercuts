  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the EH46 postcode area of Walkerburn, affecting properties in Caberston Avenue and surrounding streets. We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and became aware of this at 8:20AM. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working on the underground cable network affecting the rest of our customers without power. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the complexity of the repair required and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4PM. If this information changes then we will make every effort to contact you. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
