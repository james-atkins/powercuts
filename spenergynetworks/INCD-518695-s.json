We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to complete the repairs to our underground electricity network near the Brookfield substation affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 5pm. We will update this message if this information changes.
