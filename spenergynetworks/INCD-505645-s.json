We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 6.05pm. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of further repairs required to a grounded overhead cable and awaiting more engineers to attend site.

We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 8:04PM on Wednesday 11 November 2020.",
