Our emergency response team has managed to restore power to a number of properties, and we are working to restore power for those customers still off supply. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the extent of repairs required due to a grounded overhead line and our team are now working to get the power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 12:30pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 9:40am on 28th December 2020.",
