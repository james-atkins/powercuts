Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to locate and repair an underground cable fault affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 10.30pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 4.10pm on Saturday 16th January 2021.",
