  "TRANSCRIPT": "There is a power cut in the SY17 postcode area of Caersws, affecting properties in Clatter, Llanwnog and surrounding area. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 9.59am. Our emergency response team has managed to restore power to a number of properties, and we are working to restore power for those customers still off supply. Repairs on the overhead equipment near Clatter Post Office are taking longer than expected. Our team are now working to get the power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 12.50pm on Jan 11, 2021.",
