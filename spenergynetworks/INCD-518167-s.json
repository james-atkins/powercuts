  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the TD3, TD5 and TD10 postcode areas of Gordon, Kelso and Duns. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 6:56pm. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a damaged overhead line, caused by a fallen tree affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by midnight. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 8:50pm on Saturday 12th December 2020.",
