We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 10:57PM. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair the grounded electrical equipment on our overhead line network affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4AM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 1.06AM on 3rd February 2021.",
