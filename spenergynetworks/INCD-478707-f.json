We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have located grounded overhead lines at Causewayend in the Muiravonside area and we now expect your supply to be restored by 11.30pm due to the complexity of the repairs required. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can.
