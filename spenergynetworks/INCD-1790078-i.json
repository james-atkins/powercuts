Our control centre will attempt to reset the network remotely to restore power in stages, and our engineers have arrived onsite. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of increased travel time getting to site and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 12:00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 9:47am on Tuesday, 09 February 2021.",
