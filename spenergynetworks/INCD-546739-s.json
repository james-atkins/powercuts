  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the LL11 and LL14 postcode area of Wrexham, affecting properties in New Broughton, Caego, Bersham, Coedpoeth, Southsea, Brynteg and surrounding areas. Our emergency response team has managed to restore power to a number of properties, and we are working to restore power for those customers still affected. Our engineers have identified two faults on the underground cable network. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the extent of the work required and our team are now working to get the power back on as quickly and as safely as possible, in stages; some customers will be restored by reconfiguring the network by 1:00 pm and remaining customers, by installing generators on the network, with all customers restored by 5:00 pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 12:37 pm on 24th February, 2021.",
