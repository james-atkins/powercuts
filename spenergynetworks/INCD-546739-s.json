  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the LL11 postcode area of Wrexham, affecting properties in Dale Road, Moss Valley Road, Ogwen Close, Gatewen Road and surrounding areas. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 8:23am. Repairs are taking longer than expected as a second fault has been located on the overhead line network which has been caused by a faulty transformer. Our team are now working to get your power back on via generator as quickly and as safely as possible by 7pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 4:55pm on 24th February 2021.",
