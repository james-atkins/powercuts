  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the CW5 and SY13 postcode areas of Nantwich and Whitchurch, affecting properties in Burleydam, Aston and surrounding areas. Our emergency response team has managed to restore power to a number of properties, and we are working to restore power for those customers still off supply. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the complexity of the repairs required to a grounded overhead line following bird strike and our team are now working to get the power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 10.00PM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 6.55PM on 26th November 2020.",
