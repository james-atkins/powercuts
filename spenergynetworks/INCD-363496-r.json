We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have located a blown fuse at the Rosetta Road substation which has been caused by a fault on our underground cable network and we now expect your supply to be restored by 3pm. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can.
