  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "This is a message for customers in the FK2 postcode area of Falkirk. It was necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 4:48pm due to a damaged underground cable, caused by a third party, and this may be affecting the supply to your property. Repairs are taking longer than expected because the damaged section of cable is under water and further excavations are required. Our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 9:00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 6:15pm on Monday, 12th April 2021.",
