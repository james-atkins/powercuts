  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the G12 postcode area of Glasgow. We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have worked through the night on an underground cable fault and attempted to put generators on the network to restore power however there has been some onsite difficulties with this and the equipment and we now expect your supply to be restored by 2pm. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 7am on 2nd April",
