  "TRANSCRIPT": "There is a power cut in the KA1 and KA2 postcode areas of Kilmarnock. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 11:03am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to isolate a damaged section of underground cable, caused by a third party affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4:30pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 1:04pm on Thursday, 12th November 2020",
