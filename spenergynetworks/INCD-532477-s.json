  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut affecting the EH45 postcode area of Peebles. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 12:18am. Engineers onsite have managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are working to repair a grounded overhead line at Wester. We still expect all power to be restored by 11am. We understand that to be without power is frustrating and we apologise for this. We will update this message if this information changes. Thank you for your patience.
