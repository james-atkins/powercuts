  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "This is an update from SP Energy Networks regarding your power cut in the KA6 and KA7 postcode area of Ayr and Alloway. Our team identified an underground cable fault at Blairston Lodge. Due to the location and the accessibility of the fault it has taken us longer than normal to identify the section requiring repair. We have managed to restore power to your property via a generator whilst the repair is ongoing. We understand to be without power for a long period of time is frustrating and inconvenient and we apologise for the prolonged period of time it has taken us to restore your supply. We now expect all power to be restored by 2pm. If you require any further assistance please call us on 0800 092 9290. This message was updated at 12:50pm on 03 January, 2021",
