  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is power cut in the KA6 and KA7 postcode areas of Ayr and Alloway. We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair damaged equipment and connect generators to the fault affecting the rest of our customers without power. Repairs are taking longer than expected  due to on site difficulties, we now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 12:30pm. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
