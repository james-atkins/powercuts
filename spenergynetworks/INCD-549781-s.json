  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the KA18 and KA5 postcode areas of Cumnock and Mauchline. We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area due to the complexity of the repairs required on the underground cable network we are arranging for generators to be connected on site and we now expect your supply to be restored by 9pm. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
