Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to complete repairs on a damaged underground cable affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 8:00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 3:45pm on Friday, 05 March 2021",
