  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the KY15 postcode area of Cupar. We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 1:52pm. Our team have managed to restore power to some customers, and for those still off supply we have established a faulty underground cable in the Dalgairn area. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the complexity of the work and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6:00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 3:30pm on Thursday 18th March 2021",
