  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the KY9 and KY10  postcode areas of Leven and Anstruther. We did not know in advance there would be a power cut and became aware of this at 11.05am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working on the overhead line fault near to Craigiewells farm affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 3.15pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was recorded at 1:27pm on Wednesday, 16 December 2020",
