  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the DD6 postcode area of Tayport, affecting properties in Tay Street and surrounding streets. We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have attempted to replace a blown fuse at the Tay street substation, however this has been unsuccessful due to a fault on our underground cable network and we now expect your supply to be restored by 6:30pm. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
