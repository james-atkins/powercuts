  "MAIN_MESSAGE": "There is a power cut in the LL45 postcode area. We had no advance warning of this, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have identified a grounded overhead line near to Graig Isaf Farm and due to the poor weather conditions it is taking us longer than expected and we now expect your supply to be restored by 4:15am. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
