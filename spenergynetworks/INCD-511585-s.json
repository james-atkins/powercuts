We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 6.43pm. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair grounded overhead lines at Hawthorn Cottage, affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 10pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 7.15pm on Thursday 26th November 2020.",
