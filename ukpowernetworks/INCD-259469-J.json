The issue was caused by a fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced. During their investigations they discovered a damaged underground cable which may require repairs in the near future. We know that being without power during the current pandemic can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured that as key workers, our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.
