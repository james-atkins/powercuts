Our staff have attended our local substation in the Colyer Road area, and have found the reduced voltage is being caused by a faulted piece of equipment within this substation. Using smaller network sites in the area, they have boosted the voltage. We know there is still a problem to be fixed, however due to the materials and staff required, we're not going to be able to do this tonight. We're planning on re-attending tomorrow morning to complete repairs, so this means you won't get any further SMS updates until we do.
