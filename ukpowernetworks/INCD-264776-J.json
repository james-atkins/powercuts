Our staff are on the way to the Long Lane area, as our safety equipment within the nearby substation has operated. We believe a developing cable fault is causing these repeat power cuts, so while our estimated timeframe to have power back on is currently between 13:00 and 14:00, it's possible this may need to change once staff have assessed. This is because every power cut increases the chance that the fault has become severe enough for specialist teams to pinpoint it using specialist equipment. I'll let you know once our teams arrive.",
