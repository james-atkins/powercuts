Alongside this, they will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place on St. Wilfrids Road and St. Wilfrids Close. Please note that there will be traffic management in place on the day. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this work and thank you for your patience.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "Our contractors Avidety Ltd are replacing and upgrading electricity poles due to them decaying.  Alongside this, they will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place on St. Wilfrids Road and St. Wilfrids Close. Please note that there will be traffic management in place on the day. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this work and thank you for your patience.",
