The issue was caused by an overhead network fault, which our engineers have now diverted power around. We're sorry that we have been unable to provide you with frequent updates like we usually would. Due to the impact that Storm Bella has had on or network, we're dealing with a larger amount of faults than usual on our network. We know that being without power during the current pandemic can be especially difficult, especially over the festive period, so we're sorry for the outage.
