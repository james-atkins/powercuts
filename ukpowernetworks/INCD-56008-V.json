This work is following on from a customer&#39;s request and once completed this will ensure our network can uphold the amount of electricity being used in the area and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator within 30 minutes so your power may come on sooner. This work is taking place at Hawkhurst Treatment Works on Stream Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. To reassure you we are adhering to the latest government guidelines to keep all our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",
