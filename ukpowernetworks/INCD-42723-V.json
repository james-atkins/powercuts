This is to provide a customer with a larger electricity supply. We will also be removing overhead electricity cables and putting them underground for safety. This will ensure our electricity network can uphold the amount of electricity being used in the area and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "We are replacing and upgrading a piece of electrical equipment called a transformer, which controls and delivers electricity in your area. This is to provide a customer with a larger electricity supply. We will also be removing overhead electricity cables and putting them underground for safety. This will ensure our electricity network can uphold the amount of electricity being used in the area and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. This work is taking place at Leigh Park Farm on Coppings Road.",
