This equipment controls and delivers the electricity into your area. These are essential works that will improve the reliability of the electricity network. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator within 1 hour so your power may come on sooner. This work is taking place on the land of Priory Farm. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "The reason for this work is we are removing a piece of equipment called a transformer and connecting a new piece of equipment, called a substation, on the electricity network. This equipment controls and delivers the electricity into your area. These are essential works that will improve the reliability of the electricity network. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator within 1 hour so your power may come on sooner. This work is taking place on the land of Priory Farm. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",
