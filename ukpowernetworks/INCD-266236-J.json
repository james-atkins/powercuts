At this point we think the issue is a fault with some equipment in your local substation in the Hainton Close and Watney Market area.

After we arrive on site and assess the situation, this time may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found from our engineers tests which may take longer, and if there is not we may get power back on sooner.
