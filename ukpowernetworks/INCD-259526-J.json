Just to say thanks for your patience tonight, and to advise you I'll be passing on updates as our staff work to get your power back on. Our engineers have advised us that they are still working alongside the water board to pump the water out from our equipment. Until this has been completed, our repairs cannot begin safely, so at the moment it's not possible for us to provide you with a timeframe for power to be restored. I'll keep a close eye on the details and update you once we have further news from site, but our team are always here, 24 hours on 08003163105 if you have any questions or concerns.",
