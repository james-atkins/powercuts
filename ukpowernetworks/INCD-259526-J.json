We're sorry we had to turn your power off due to the flooding which affected our equipment, but our staff have now made the area safe enough to re-energise our network. I know a power cut during the current lock down is especially worrying, so I'm sorry for the length of time your electricity was off, and we appreciate your patience. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
