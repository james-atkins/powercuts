This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and that the trees are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. During this second national lockdown, the government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities. This outage falls into this category, which is why we are completing this during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place in Cranbrook Road. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe.We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this work and thank you for your patience.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "A third party has requested that UK Power Networks switch off the power to allow them to carry out tree trimming safely around our overhead electricity cables. This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and that the trees are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. During this second national lockdown, the government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities. This outage falls into this category, which is why we are completing this during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place in Cranbrook Road. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe.We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this work and thank you for your patience.",
