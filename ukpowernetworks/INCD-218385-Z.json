I'm sorry for the delays in restoring your power today, I know being without power for this long isn't easy, especially in colder weather. Our staff have been in contact to advise progress on the excavations and repairs has been slower than anticipated, and so they need a while longer to get power back on safely. We're now estimating power will be back on between 16:00 and 17:00. I'm sorry to advise you another delay, but I'll continue to keep you updated with our progress as it comes in from site.
