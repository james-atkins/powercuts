This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this work and thank you for your patience. This work is taking place on Wrotham Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.",
