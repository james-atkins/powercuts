The issue was caused by a tree coming into contact with our overhead cabling, causing substation equipment to operate. Our engineers turned off further power to allow them to safety cut back the tree and replace the substation equipment. We know that being without power during the current pandemic can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured that as key workers, our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.
