Our engineers have been in contact with us to let us know that they have been able to divert electricity around the faulty part of the network, restoring power to some customers and repairs are still ongoing in order to get everyone back on. To give them time to restore the remaining affected properties safely, the estimated timeframe to restore your power is now between 00:00 and 01:00. We're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",
