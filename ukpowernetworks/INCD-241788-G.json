The issue was caused by a fault on a section of overhead cables, which our engineers have now repaired.

Due to the impact that Storm Bella has had on or network, we're dealing with a larger amount of faults than usual on our network. We know that being without power during the current pandemic can be especially difficult, especially over today, so we're sorry for the outage.
