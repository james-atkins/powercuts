Specialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible for your power to come back on at any point, but sometimes we can't restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment. Every fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated, but currently we hope to have power back on between 07:00 and 08:00.
