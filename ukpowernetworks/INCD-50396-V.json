This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. You may see our contractors completing works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 10:00 and back on at 16:00, however the checks may take longer so please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the power cut. This work is taking place on Forewood Lane",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "Our contractors Avidety Ltd are replacing and upgrading electricity poles due to them decaying and replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. You may see our contractors completing works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 10:00 and back on at 16:00, however the checks may take longer so please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the power cut. This work is taking place on Forewood Lane",
