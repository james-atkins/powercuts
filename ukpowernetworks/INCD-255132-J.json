Currently, our timeframe for power to be restored is between 21:00 and 22:00, but once our staff arrive on site and assess the situation, this time may change. As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so timeframes we provide throughout have to be estimated. The results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as they have arrived on site and investigated.",
