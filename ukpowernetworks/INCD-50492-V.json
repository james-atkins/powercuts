    "PlannedIncidentReason": "The reason for this work is we are replacing a piece of equipment, called a transformer, on the electricity network. These are essential works that will improve the reliability of the electricity network, ensure our network can uphold the amount of electricity in your area and will also reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. Due to safety reasons our engineers need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 08:30 and back on at 15:30, however the checks may take longer so please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the power cut. This work is taking place in Down Street. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "The reason for this work is we are replacing a piece of equipment, called a transformer, on the electricity network. These are essential works that will improve the reliability of the electricity network, ensure our network can uphold the amount of electricity in your area and will also reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. Due to safety reasons our engineers need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 08:30 and back on at 15:30, however the checks may take longer so please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the power cut. This work is taking place in Down Street. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.",
