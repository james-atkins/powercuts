We're sorry it's taken us longer than we expected to restore your power today. Please accept our sincere apologies as we know that it's difficult to be without power for a longer duration, and during the current pandemic this can be especially difficult, but please rest assured that as key workers our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on. If your power isn't back on, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105, free from landlines and mobiles.",
