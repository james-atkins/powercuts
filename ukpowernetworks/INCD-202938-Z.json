Originally, we believed this issue to be a fault on our network, but we have been made aware that due a grounded overhead cable, our engineers have had to turn power off remotely to 257 customers in the interest of public safety. Using an average timeframe for this type of powercut, we are currently estimating to have the power back on between 08:30 and 09:30. We'll let you know once engineers get to site and keep you updated.",

We didn’t know in advance there would be a power cut, but now that we know, our teams will do everything they can to get your power back quickly.
