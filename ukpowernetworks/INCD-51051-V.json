This is following on from local residents raising concerns over the quality of supply in your area. This work needs to take place to ensure our electricity network is working to the best of its ability whilst reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. To ensure our engineers can carry out these works safely we will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work is taking place in our Brooklands substation on Boarmans Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",

This is following on from local residents raising concerns over the quality of supply in your area. This work needs to take place to ensure our electricity network is working to the best of its ability whilst reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. To ensure our engineers can carry out these works safely we will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work is taking place in our Brooklands substation on Boarmans Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe.
