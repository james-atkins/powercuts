They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing. We know that with the current pandemic, our customers are more worried now than ever about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 6 hours in the fridge, and between 15-24 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",
