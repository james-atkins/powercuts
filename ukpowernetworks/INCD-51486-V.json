To enable us to work close to the low voltage overhead electricity cables and cut the trees safely our engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work needs to take place for safety reasons, along with reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place at the junction of Ross Gardens and Rough Common Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "We have identified that there are trees close to our low voltage overhead electricity cables that urgently need trimming. To enable us to work close to the low voltage overhead electricity cables and cut the trees safely our engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work needs to take place for safety reasons, along with reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place at the junction of Ross Gardens and Rough Common Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.",
