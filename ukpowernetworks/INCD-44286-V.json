This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why its important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. This work is taking place on The Street. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "A third party has requested that UK Power Networks switch off the power to allow them to carry out tree trimming safely around our overhead electricity cables. This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why its important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. This work is taking place on The Street. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",
