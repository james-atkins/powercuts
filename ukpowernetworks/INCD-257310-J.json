We know the underlying problem is on an underground cable so our engineers are installing specialist network equipment to help trace where on the cable the issue is. The installed equipment can report back on a location to allow us to make full repairs. If you'd like more information on the issue, or if your power isn't back on, call us on 08003163105 (free to call). We know that being without power during the current pandemic can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.
