They have advised that the majority of power to the area has been restored safely, as it's only now necessary for a small number of properties to remain without power while we make repairs. If your power is back on, send CANCEL to 80876 to stop SMS updates. Otherwise, our staff have advised the issue with our overhead cabling is very close to scaffolding, which is complicating the repairs and so they have offered an estimated timeframe of 19:30-20:30 for power to be restored. I'm sorry for the length of time this may take, but I'll keep you updated with all of our progress.",
