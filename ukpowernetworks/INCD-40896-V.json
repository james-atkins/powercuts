This is following on from an unplanned power cut that may have affected you on the 13th July 2020 which was caused by a third party damaging one of our high voltage underground electricity cables. To restore our electricity network back to normal running conditions we will need to temporarily switch off your power. Once completed this will ensure our electricity network is working to the best of its ability and will ensure quality of supply. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. This work is taking place in a field near Chuck Hatch Road.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "We are upgrading the high voltage electricity network in your area. This is following on from an unplanned power cut that may have affected you on the 13th July 2020 which was caused by a third party damaging one of our high voltage underground electricity cables. To restore our electricity network back to normal running conditions we will need to temporarily switch off your power. Once completed this will ensure our electricity network is working to the best of its ability and will ensure quality of supply. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. This work is taking place in a field near Chuck Hatch Road.",
