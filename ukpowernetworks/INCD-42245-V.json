This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut, which is why it&#39;s important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. During this time you will be connected to a temporary generator to provide you with power whilst we carry out these essential works. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator as soon as possible so your power may come on sooner. This work taking place in and around Fleets Lane. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "Our contractors Avidety Ltd are replacing and upgrading high voltage electricity poles due to them coming to the end of their serviceable lives. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut, which is why it&#39;s important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. During this time you will be connected to a temporary generator to provide you with power whilst we carry out these essential works. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator as soon as possible so your power may come on sooner. This work taking place in and around Fleets Lane. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",
