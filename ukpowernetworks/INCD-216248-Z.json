Our engineers discovered the issue was caused by an overhead network fault which caused low volts and loss of power. We have now remotely diverted supplies around the fault. We know that being without power during the current pandemic can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured that as key workers, our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.
