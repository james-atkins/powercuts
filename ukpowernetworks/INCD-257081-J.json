Our engineers turned off the power to safely repair what was reported as a damage to one our underground cables caused by another company working in the Palantine Road area. However after carrying out their excavations, no damage was found. The area was deemed safe and power then restored. We know that being without power during the current pandemic can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured that as key workers, our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.
