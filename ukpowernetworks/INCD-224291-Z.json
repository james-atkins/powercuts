Due to the impact of the strong winds and heavy rain across our network, we are currently unable to update customers as often as we would like. Our engineers are working on site to repair a fault on the overhead network. We're currently estimating to have all the power back on between 14:30 and 15:30. We will continue to communicate with the team and update you as often as possible.",
