Our engineers have completed investigations and have advised they will need to expose further cabling in order to safely repair the damage. To give them time to do this safely, we've had to change the estimated timeframe to restore your power to between 21:30 and 22:30. We're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",
