I want to assure you that as keyworkers, our teams operate 24 hours a day, and we continue to work around the clock for our customers without reducing our workforce. For both our businesses customers and those at home, we will work as quickly and safely as possible to restore supplies. If you need any additional support or have any concerns, please call us on 105 or tweet us @ukpowernetworks. I will personally continue to keep you updated with our progress.",
