Our engineers have advised that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in restoring your power. This is due to the bad weather conditions with the snow slowing down the progression of the works. We now estimate to switch your power back on at approximately 15:00. Our reference number for this work is INCD-5411-O. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the PE37 postcode area then please call 105.",
