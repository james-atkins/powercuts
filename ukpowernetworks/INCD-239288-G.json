Excavations are underway, however our engineers believe the cabling is buried quite shallowly. To be safe, they have turned off further power in the area so our cabling is de-energised. They have also advised that with the amount of work there may be to do, we do need to adjust our timeframe; so we're now estimating power will be on between 13:30 and 14:30. I'm sorry to advise you a delay, but I'll keep a close on the details and pass on further news as it comes in. If you have any concerns, our team are always here on 08003163105.",
