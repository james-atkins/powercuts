After investigations, we can now confirm that the issue is a damaged underground cable caused by another company. I understand how difficult it can be without power, and the additional worries this can bring during a pandemic. I want to reassure you that as keyworkers our teams operate 24 hours a day, as we continue to work around the clock for our customers without reducing our workforce . For both our businesses customers and those at home, we will be on hand to work as quickly and safely as possible to restore supplies. If you need any additional support, please call us on 105 or tweet us @ukpowernetworks. I will continue to personally keep you updated with our progress.",
