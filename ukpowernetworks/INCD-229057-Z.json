For this reason, It has taken us longer than we expected to restore your power today. Please accept our sincere apology as we know that it is difficult to be without power for a longer duration. If your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.
