Our equipment needs to be regularly checked to ensure our electricity network is working to the best of its ability whilst reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. To ensure our engineers can carry out these works safely we will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work is taking place in the carpark of Site 1 Albert Drive Industrial Estate. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "Our engineers are needing to urgently complete this work to carry out critical safety related maintenance on some of our equipment called Switchgear within one of our substations, which controls, protects and isolates electrical equipment on our electricity network. Our equipment needs to be regularly checked to ensure our electricity network is working to the best of its ability whilst reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. To ensure our engineers can carry out these works safely we will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work is taking place in the carpark of Site 1 Albert Drive Industrial Estate. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",
