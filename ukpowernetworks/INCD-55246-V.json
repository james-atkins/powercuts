Our staff have discovered the issue has been caused by a fault on our overhead network that affected our substation equipment. They are now in the process of locating the fault.

Food should keep for up to 6 hours in the fridge, and between 15-24 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",
