The issue was caused by trees bringing down our overhead cables, which our engineers have now trimmed back and repaired.

Due to the impact that Storm Bella has had on or network, we're dealing with a larger amount of faults than usual on our network. We know that being without power during the current pandemic can be especially difficult, especially over the festive period, so we're sorry for the outage.
