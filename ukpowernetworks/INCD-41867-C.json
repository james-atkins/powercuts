As any issues that currently exist on our network have affected our equipment at the substation, engineers will start their testing there. They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power. The estimated timeframe to have the power back on is between 18:30 and 19:30, however if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed. This can involve ground excavations, traffic management equipment or specialist teams. As soon as our staff can safely update us, we'll give you the latest news.",
