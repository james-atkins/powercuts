We currently estimate that your power will be back on between 20:00 and 21:00, but after we arrive on site and assess the situation, this time could change. The reason for this is that sometimes there can be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineers tests. Also, just to make you aware, in some cases we have to restore power in stages; so it is normal to continue receiving messages for a while even after your power has come back on.
