Our engineers have been in contact with us to let us know that a fault on an underground cable in the Burrow Road area is causing safety equipment to operate. They still need to locate and repair the fault. To give them time to do this safely, the estimated timeframe to restore your power is now between 14:30 and 15:30. We're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",
