Our engineers have now repaired the grounded cable, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all properties in the Bishops Stortford CM22 area. We're very sorry we had to turn your power off with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we need to interrupt power, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff. We know that being without power during the current pandemic can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured that as key workers, our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.
