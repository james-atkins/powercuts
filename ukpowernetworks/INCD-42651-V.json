You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage including the delivery of materials, this is to reduce the impact/duration on the day of the outage. Due to the nature of the planned works which are needing to be completed, we would have wanted to do this within the warmer months, however by completing the planned works now this should prevent you from experiencing an unplanned powercut and stop the electricity poles from potentially falling over.

This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage including the delivery of materials, this is to reduce the impact/duration on the day of the outage. Due to the nature of the planned works which are needing to be completed, we would have wanted to do this within the warmer months, however by completing the planned works now this should prevent you from experiencing an unplanned powercut and stop the electricity poles from potentially falling over. This work is taking place in and around Janes Lane.",
