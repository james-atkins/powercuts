Our engineers have turned off the power in the Sittingbourne and Maidstone area in the interest of the public's health and safety. This is so they can investigate reports of a grounded overhead line. Due to the impact of Storm Bella creating a larger than usual volume of faults, the estimated time to have you back on is between 16:00 and 17:00. We'll keep you updated with our progress.",

We didn’t know in advance there would be a power cut, but now that we know, our teams will do everything they can to get your power back quickly. Engineers in our control room have switched some customers power back on in your area. To get everyone’s power back on we may need to attend to investigate and make repairs.
