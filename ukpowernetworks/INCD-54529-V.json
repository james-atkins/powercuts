To enable us to work close to our high voltage overhead electricity cables and cut the trees safely our engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work needs to take place for safety reasons, along with reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place near the junction of Hailsham Road and Cricketing Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this work and thank you for your patience.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "We have identified that there are trees close to our high voltage overhead electricity cables that need trimming. To enable us to work close to our high voltage overhead electricity cables and cut the trees safely our engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work needs to take place for safety reasons, along with reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place near the junction of Hailsham Road and Cricketing Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this work and thank you for your patience.",
