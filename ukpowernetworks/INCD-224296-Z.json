We didn’t know in advance there would be a power cut, but now that we know, our teams will do everything they can to get your power back quickly. Engineers in our control room have switched some customers power back on in your area. To get everyone’s power back on we may need to attend to investigate and make repairs. We’ll continue to update you until everyone’s power is back on.</p>",
