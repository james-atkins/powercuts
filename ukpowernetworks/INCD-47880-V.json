We have made a call to site for an update and our engineers have advised us that they have diverted power around the fault and restored some properties. For those still affected, we've had to make a change to the timeframe. This is due to additional digging still required to expose the faulty underground cable. We're now estimating to have your power back on between 23:30 and 00:30. We're aware some of the properties affected earlier have now been restored when we redirected supplies around the fault.
