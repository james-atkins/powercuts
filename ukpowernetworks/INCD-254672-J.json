Our engineers have been in contact with us to let us know that due to complications in locating the fault and the amount of excavating and repair work that still needs to be done. To give them time to do this safely, the estimated timeframe to restore your power is now between 21:00 and 22:00. We're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",
