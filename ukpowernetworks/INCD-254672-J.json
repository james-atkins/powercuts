Our engineers have made partial repairs to the underground cabling. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used a temporary generator to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days. We're really sorry for any disruption this caused.
