We always aim to give as much notice as possible, though some customers may have experienced unplanned power cuts on the 21st and 22nd March 2021 which is way we urgently need to complete these works. This planned power cut is unavoidable but please be assured that we are doing this to remove the fault from the electricity network and enhance the reliability of the electricity network in your area. Our customer service vehicle will be on site for the duration of the planned works and will be able to provide support and information on the day. This work is taking place on Marshbank Road outside block 13-23. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "There is a fault on our underground electricity cables that needs repairing urgently and in order to repair the fault safely our engineers need to switch off your power. We always aim to give as much notice as possible, though some customers may have experienced unplanned power cuts on the 21st and 22nd March 2021 which is way we urgently need to complete these works. This planned power cut is unavoidable but please be assured that we are doing this to remove the fault from the electricity network and enhance the reliability of the electricity network in your area. Our customer service vehicle will be on site for the duration of the planned works and will be able to provide support and information on the day. This work is taking place on Marshbank Road outside block 13-23. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.
