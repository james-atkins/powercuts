Specialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible for your power to come back on at any point, but sometimes we can't restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment. Every fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated, but currently we hope to have power back on between 11:00 and 12:00. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find. We'll keep you updated with our progress, but if you need to talk our team are always here on 08003163105.",

We didn’t know in advance there would be a power cut, but now that we know, our teams will do everything they can to get your power back quickly. Engineers in our control room have switched some customers power back on in your area. To get everyone’s power back on we may need to attend to investigate and make repairs. We’ll continue to update you until everyone’s power is back on.</p>",
