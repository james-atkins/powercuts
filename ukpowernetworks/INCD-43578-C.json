Unfortunately, it's going to take us past our current timeframe to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 18:30 and 19:30 to have power back on. We can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, call our team anytime on 08003163105. I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site.",
