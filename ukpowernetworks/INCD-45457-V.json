They will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. You may see our contractors erecting the new electricity poles prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day. This work is taking place ouside properties on Calfstock Lane, Dartford Road and Franks Lane. Please note that 2 way traffic lights will be used on the day. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this work and thank you for your patience.",
