Our engineers are carrying out critical maintenance on a piece of equipment called a transformer on our high voltage electricity network. This will enable our engineers to reduce the voltage following on from high voltage complaints affecting some customers in the area. This work will bring improvements in supply security and ensuring our network remains working to the best of its ability, which is why it is important to complete this working during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Thong Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "This outage was previously scheduled for the 11/02/2021 but was cancelled due Storm Darcy. Our engineers are carrying out critical maintenance on a piece of equipment called a transformer on our high voltage electricity network. This will enable our engineers to reduce the voltage following on from high voltage complaints affecting some customers in the area. This work will bring improvements in supply security and ensuring our network remains working to the best of its ability, which is why it is important to complete this working during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Thong Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",
