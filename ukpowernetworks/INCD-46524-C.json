It's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using test fuses to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues. Our cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites called linkboxes. Our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our timeframe hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.",
