  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "We are diverting a section of our high voltage electricity cables to allow for the safe widening of a water course and construction of a new bridge related to the A27 road widening project. This will ensure that these works are carried out in a safe environment whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut whilst these works are completed. This work is taking place at Brighton City Airport. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category, which is why we are completing this work during the Coronavirus pandemic.",
