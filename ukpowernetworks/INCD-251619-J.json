Following recent planning our engineers have been granted access to the substation which will enable them to safely connect a new building to our electiricity network. We have a duty to connect all customers who apply for electricity, to our network. Once the work is completed this will ensure there is enough electricity to uphold the electricity being used within the area, preventing unplanned power cuts. This is why It is important to complete during the coronavirus pandemic. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We estimate the power to be off for 3 hours but if the engineers will do all they can to get the power back on sooner.
