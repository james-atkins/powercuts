Our staff are on the way to the George Street and Church Street area, as our safety equipment within the nearby substation has operated. We believe a developing cable fault is causing these repeat power cuts, so while our estimated timeframe to have power back on is currently between 09:30 and 10:30, it's possible this may need to change once staff have assessed. This is because every power cut increases the chance that the fault has become severe enough for specialist teams to pinpoint it using specialist equipment. I'll let you know once our teams arrive.",
