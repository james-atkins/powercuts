We know there is an underlying issue causing this, but it is proving difficult for our engineers to locate and therefore fix. To get your power back on today we have reconfigured the local electricity network. This in turn will both help pinpoint the issue and minimise further interruptions.

We know that being without power during the current pandemic can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.
