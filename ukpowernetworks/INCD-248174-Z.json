Our staff are on the way to the Malcolm Crescent area, as our substation equipment has operated again. Our current estimated timeframe to restore power is between 01:30 and 02:30, but this is based on our staff being able to restore your power by replacing the substation equipment. As this has happened several times in recently, it indicates a cabling fault. This may have reached a point where our safety equipment will not replace safely, meaning the fault has become visible. If this happens, we'll arrange further specialist teams to attend and repair it. I'll keep you updated.",
