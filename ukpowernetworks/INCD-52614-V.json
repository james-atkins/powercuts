This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place in and around the Poppinghole Lane and Heathfield Gardens area. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "Our contractors Avidety Ltd are replacing and upgrading electricity poles due to them coming to the end of their serviceable lives. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place in and around the Poppinghole Lane and Heathfield Gardens area. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.",
