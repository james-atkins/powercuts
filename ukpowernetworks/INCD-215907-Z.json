We did not know this was going to happen, so timeframes we provide throughout are estimated, and are subject to change. Our estimate is currently between 20:30 and 21:30. After we arrive on site and assess the situation, this time may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found from our engineers tests which may take longer, and if there is not we may get power back on sooner.
