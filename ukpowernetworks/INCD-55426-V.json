Alongside this, they will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place outside Skid Hill House on Skid Hill Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. To reassure you we are adhering to the latest government guidelines to keep all our customers and colleagues safe. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this work and thank you for your patience.",
