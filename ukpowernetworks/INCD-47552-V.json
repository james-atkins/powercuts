This equipment controls and delivers the electricity into your area. This is to allow for the connection of the new Discovery Centre and will ensure our network can uphold the amount of electricity in your area. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. In order to connect and disconnect the generator safely we will need to temporarily switch off your power. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator within 30 minutes so your power may come on sooner. This work is taking place at the new Discovery Centre at Rye Harbour. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "The reason for this work is we are installing a new piece of equipment, called a substation, on the electricity network. This equipment controls and delivers the electricity into your area. This is to allow for the connection of the new Discovery Centre and will ensure our network can uphold the amount of electricity in your area. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. In order to connect and disconnect the generator safely we will need to temporarily switch off your power. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator within 30 minutes so your power may come on sooner. This work is taking place at the new Discovery Centre at Rye Harbour. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",
