To fix the issue permanently we're trying to find the underlying root cause, however with this kind of issue it's likely that power will go off multiple times before we're able to find and fix it. For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can. If your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power during the current pandemic can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.
