We know a power cut is disruptive, especially with so many people currently working at home. We appreciate this is an added concern, so we want to provide some advice for anyone in this situation. You can use your phone as a personal hotspot to keep an internet connection (be aware of the data limit your network provider allows for this), use a battery pack to keep your devices charged and adjust the power settings on any laptops or mobile devices to extend their lifespan. If your neighbours are still on power, maybe ask to see if they can share access to their Wi-Fi network temporarily.",
