Our engineers have advised us that all works progressed well on site and have been completed ahead of schedule. All properties will now be restored by approximately 15:15. Now the high voltage transformer has been replaced in Bewlays this will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you experiencing an unplanned power outage. Our reference number for this work is INCD-240454-Z. \nWe would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. As we aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel there is more we could have done for your situation or if you have any questions then please give us a call on 105.",
