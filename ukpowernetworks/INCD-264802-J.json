Our engineers have been in contact with us to let us know that they are still working to divert power around the equipment fault. To give them time to do this safely, the estimated timeframe to restore your power is now between 16:00 and 17:00. We're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",
