Our staff are on the way to the St Leonards Road area, and our estimated timeframe to have power back on is currently between 10:00 and 11:00. However, this could change once our staff have assessed. We believe these issues are being caused by a cabling fault and if this has developed to a severe enough stage, the cabling circuit may be broken - this means further specialist staff can use fault finding equipment to locate and repair it. I'll let you know once our teams arrive, but we're always here to speak to on 08003163105.",
