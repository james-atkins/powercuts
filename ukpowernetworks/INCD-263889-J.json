Our engineers have now safely connected temporary generators, and these will be providing your power while our engineers work to fully repair the fault on the underground cabling. Depending on what the issue is, it may take a few days for our engineers to plan in the work and make their repairs, but once this is completed safely the generators can be removed, and network power will be resumed.
