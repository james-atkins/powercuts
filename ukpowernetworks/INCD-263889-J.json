Our engineers have been in touch to advise the ground they're having to dig through is tougher than expected and is slowing their progress. They are still continuing but due to this we have had to make another change to the estimated time frame. We're now estimating to have the power back on between 21:30 and 22:30. We're very sorry for this and for how frustrating this must be for you. Our team are here if you have any concerns. Just call us free on 105 or you can speak to us via Facebook and Twitter at @ukpowernetworks. Our engineers will work as quickly as they can to restore supplies and I will continue to keep you updated with any further news we receive.",
