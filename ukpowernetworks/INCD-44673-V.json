This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete the work during the Coronavirus outbreak. You may see our contractors prior to the date stated completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. The government has given exemptions to certain industries & activities, this outage falls into this category. The work is taking place outside Corner View, Dex Property Management, Foxes End, Selhurst and Little orchard.",
