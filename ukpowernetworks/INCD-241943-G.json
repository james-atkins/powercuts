Our engineers have been in contact with us to let us know that the extent of work required to remove the trees from the overhead cables is proving much more complex then originally thought.To give them time to do this safely, the estimated timeframe to restore your power is now between 21:30 and 22:30. We're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",
