Thank you for your patience while our engineers repaired a fault on the underground network in the Broadhurst Gardens area, we've now restored power to most of the affected properties. There are now only 2 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. Please accept our sincere apology as we know that it is difficult to be without power for a longer duration. This was due to the complexity of the repairs required and internal checks being required. If your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles. We're really sorry for any disruption this caused.",
