Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to be focusing their tests on whether the network is still healthy. They will start at the substation, and often apply specialist equipment that may turn your power back on for a brief period, so don't worry if your power comes on and goes off again. They will also check smaller sites which run along our cabling route, these break our network down into smaller sections and can help pinpoint any possible problems.
