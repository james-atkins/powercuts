We've liaised with our engineers and they have advised that due to the nature of the fault, there's an extensive amount of work required before we are able to safely restore the power in the area. Due to the repairs still required, we've had to make a change to the estimated timeframe. We're now estimating to have the power back on between 01:30 and 02:30. I'm sorry we've had to change the timeframe and appreciate how frustrating this is. We will continue to communicate with the team and I will update you with any further news.",
