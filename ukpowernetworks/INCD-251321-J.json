This work is following on from a customers request and due to the type of underground electricity cables we need to make the connection to, engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power to ensure they can carry out this work safely. These works will ensure our electricity network can uphold the electricity in the area and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut, which is why its important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. This work is taking place in our substation located in the corner of the car park under Astra House, in Arklow Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "*Please be aware that this is the planned power cut that was originally scheduled for 07/12/20 but was cancelled* We are carrying out these works to connect a new cable to the underground electricity network which will give power to a new development being constructed. This work is following on from a customers request and due to the type of underground electricity cables we need to make the connection to, engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power to ensure they can carry out this work safely. These works will ensure our electricity network can uphold the electricity in the area and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut, which is why its important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. This work is taking place in our substation located in the corner of the car park under Astra House, in Arklow Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.",
