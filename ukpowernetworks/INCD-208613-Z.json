Our engineers have been in contact with us to let us know that they require extra assistance on site to help with repairs, and may also need to switch off more power in the area in order to complete repairs. Due to this, the estimated timeframe to restore your power is now between 17:30 and 18:30. We're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",
