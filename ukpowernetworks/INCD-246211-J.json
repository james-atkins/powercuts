Our engineers have been in contact to let us know that we can now confirm that the power is off due to a damaged cable caused by another company, which triggered our substation safety equiment. We have also had to isolate further supplies to allow safe repairs. To give them time to complete their work to the cable safely, the estimated timeframe to restore your power is now between 21:30 and 22:30. We're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",
