This work is following on from a customers request and to ensure they can carry out this work safely we need to temporarily switch off your power. This work will ensure that our electricity network can uphold the electricity usage in your area whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place in Stafford Close. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",

  "IncidentCategoryCustomerFriendlyDescription": "**These works were originally planned for the 31st March 2021 but were cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances** We are carrying out these works to install a new low voltage overhead cable to connect a new property to the overhead electricity electricity network. This work is following on from a customers request and to ensure they can carry out this work safely we need to temporarily switch off your power. This work will ensure that our electricity network can uphold the electricity usage in your area whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place in Stafford Close. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.",
