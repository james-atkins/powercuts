The reason for this work is we are upgrading a piece of electrical equipment known as a pole transformer. This will enable new properties to be connected to our electricity network and will ensure our electricity network can uphold the amount of electricity being used in the area. This is why this important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. We are supporting a third party in delivering these works, proceeding with these works helps keep the economy moving. This work is taking place outside Queenwood House on Chobham Road.",
